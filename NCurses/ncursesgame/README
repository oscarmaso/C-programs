*how to run
+ get gcc (might not need to)
+ get ncurses (again might not need to)
+ stick this folder in your home folder
+ do these in the terminal to compile (you probably wont need to do these)

cd /home/<your name>/ncursesgame/files
gcc -o buildinggame buildinggame.cpp.cpp -lncurses
cd /home/<yourname>/ncursesgame
make GAMESTART

+ then to run double click "GAMESTART" (you can put the GAMESTART file anywhere on your computer)

*controls
+ 'b' and 'v' to scroll through block menu
+ space bar to place block
+ wasd to delete items relative to you (ex: 'w' to delete item above u)
+ arrow keys to move
+ 'r' to reset to pos (0,0) if you get stuck
+ 't' and 'g' to cycle through menu
+ enter button to excecute menu command

*bugs
+ you can get stuck in '#' blocks. press and hold 'r' to get out
+ menu is a bit glitchy. every time after starting the game or using an item on the menu, move the menu cursor about 3 times for it to straighten out :) IF YOU DONT YOU CAN EASILY DELETE YOUR SAVE ON ACCIDENT!!!

*things to be added soon
+ a menu item to reset your amount of stars
+ a file to save your amount of stars when you save your world (should be easy but i dont really want to :/ )
+ change the '[' and ']' to something else because it is hard to use for some reason with the new block chooser (maybe give me an idea of what it should be?)
