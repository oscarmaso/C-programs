*stick this in your home folder.
*go into ncursesv6.cpp and go to line ~85 and line ~88 and change ty to your username. this will be changed soon
*do these in the terminal to compile:

cd ncursesgame
gcc -o ncursesv6 ncursesv6.cpp -lncurses

*then to run do

./ncursesv6      (make sure you are still in cd ncursesgame!)

*how to play
+ 1-5 to place items
+ wasd to delete items relative to you (ex: 'w' to delete item above u)
+ arrow keys to move
+ 'r' to reset to pos (0,0) if you get stuck
+ 'q' to end game
+ 'k' to save game
+ 'l' to load game

*bugs
+ after loading up a save, items dont work. ex: you can walk through a '#' thats been loaded up (will work on!!!)
+ you can get a gold star without going up to the baker ai by simple pressing 'y' (dont do it!)
+ you can get stuck in '#' blocks. press and hold 'r' to get out
+ screen doesnt load correctly unless you have terminal in full screen
